# Image-analyses
These are two equal pipelines that can be used to analyse tweets (from URL) and images (from file locations) and perform different ML algo. 
Specifically, some algorithms are for object descriptions and others are for object recognition. Overall, each has its own strengths and weakness. Obviously, this can depend on the labels it was trained on as well as the training.
